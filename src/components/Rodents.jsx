      <h2>Rodent Control</h2>

      <h3>What is a Rodent and Rodent Control?</h3>
      <p>
        Pest Control services have rodent control as their premium pest control
        service. Rodent is a gnawing mammal of an order that includes rats,
        mice, squirrels, hamsters, porcupines, and their relatives,
        distinguished by strong constantly growing incisors and no canine teeth.
        They constitute the largest order of mammals.Rodents are a group of
        nuisance pests that includes mice, rats, and squirrels. These animals
        can contaminate food, damage property, and spread disease.
      </p>

      <h3>Types of Rodents-</h3>
      <p>
        Order Rodentia is comprised of over 2,000 species, which are subdivided
        into many families.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Capromyidae, Castoridae, Cricetidae, Erethizontidae, Muridae,
        Sciuridae and Dipodidae are some of the most common families. The Family
        Muridae is the largest, containing nearly two-thirds of all rodent
        species. This family includes several subfamilies and includes sand
        rats, gerbils, crested rats and old-world rats and mice.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many different rodent types which have been identified. The
        different types can be distinguished by their differences in physical
        appearance as well as genetics. The types often are grouped together
        with similar types.

      <h3>How Rodents are harmful for human society?</h3>
      <p>
        Rodents are one of the major causes of damage to crops and electrical
        systems throughout the world. With their ever-growing teeth, rodents,
        such as rats and mice, are constantly gnawing on things and are able to
        chew away at power lines that provide people with electricity. As
        carriers of contagious diseases and hosts of infectious parasites,
        rodents also contaminate food supplies and spoil gardens throughout
        Third World and industrialized nations.
      </p>
      <p>
        With their ability to crawl through pipes and slip into hard-to-reach
        areas, rodents come into contact with sensitive circuitry that connects
        to power grids in towns and cities everywhere. Using their sharp
        incisors, the critters gnaw at electrical wires and insulation
        materials, causing short circuits and sparking fires in the process. The
        older a rodent grows, the stronger its teeth become, hence the need to
        chew on hard objects.
      </p>
      <p>
        As carriers of pests, rodents bring along fleas, mites, and ticks with
        each infestation. Rodents are also carriers of diseases, and there are
        many that are transmittable to humans, pets, and farm animals; examples
        include leptospirosis, salmonella, tapeworms, and tuberculosis. The
        rodents are also contagious for what they leave behind, like urine,
        droppings, and saliva â€” all of which can be disease-ridden themselves
      </p>
      <p>
        Rats and mice have also been responsible for major damage to store
        supplies, home furnishings, and even buildings. Locations and items
        especially susceptible to damage
      </p>

      <h3>Ways to get rid of rats and mice</h3>
      <p>
        Rodent control is a very potential service of pest control. Rodent
        Control is controlling infestation and growth of Rodents, that is rats
        and mice, in a premise.Prevention method should be implemented early,
        such as mouse traps, rodent repellents mouse traps etc, in order to
        maintain a rodent-free home. Rodents reproduce rapidly, and small
        populations become full-blown infestations in very little time. Rat
        traps, rodent repellents, mouse traps, etc are used for pest and rodent
        control in a house.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rodents are some of the most adaptable creatures on the planet and can
        be extremely difficult to exterminate. It is recommended that anyone
        experiencing a rodent infestation contact a pest control service
        professional to arrange for a consultation. Professionals are trained
        not only to address current infestations but also to prevent future
        infestations. Scheduling a home inspection may help you get rid of
        rodents
