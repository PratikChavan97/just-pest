      <h2>House Fly Control</h2>
      <p>
        The First step in House fly control is exclusion and sanitation. After
        these measures, you can use insecticides that come in residual forms,
        aerosols, fogging materials, and baiting forms. Fly traps have long been
        a favourite. There are many forms of fly traps, from disposable fly
        traps to electronic fly light traps with replaceable light bulbs and
        glue boards.
      </p>

      <h3>Exclusion and Sanitation</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Sanitation is the first measure of defence, even though there are
          various traps and sprays that are used to kill flies, it is necessary
          to eliminate the source in order to eliminate them.
        </li>
        <li>
          Whenever possible, food and materials on which the flies can lay their
          eggs must be removed or destroyed, which will isolate the egg-laying
          adult. Killing adult flies will reduce infestation, but elimination of
          breeding areas is necessary for good House Fly control management.
        </li>
        <li>
          Garbage cans and dumpsters should have tight-fitting lids and be
          cleaned regularly.
        </li>
        <li>Drainage will often aid control, getting rid of extra moisture.</li>
        <li>Openings of buildings should be tightly screened with screen.</li>

      <h3>House Fly</h3>
      <p>
        The housefly, also house-fly or house fly or Musca domestica, is the
        most common fly occurring in homes and indeed one of the most widely
        distributed animals and the most familiar of all flies; it is a pest
        that can facilitate serious diseases.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is the most common fly species found in houses. Adults are grey to
        black, with four dark, longitudinal lines on the thorax, slightly hairy
        bodies, and a single pair of membranous wings. They have red eyes, set
        further apart in the slightly larger female.
      </p>
      <p>
        The female housefly usually mates only once and stores the sperm for
        later use. She lays batches of about 100 eggs on decaying organic matter
        such as food waste, carrion or feces These soon hatch into legless,
        white larvae, maggots. After 2 to 5 days of development, these
        metamorphose into reddish-brown pupae, about 8 mm (0.3 in) long. Adult
        flies normally live for 2 to 4 weeks but can hibernate during the
        winter.
      </p>
      <p>
        The adults feed on a variety of liquid or semiliquid substances, as well
        as solid materials which have been softened by their saliva. They can
        carry pathogens on their bodies and in their feces, contaminate food,
        and contribute to the transfer of foodborne diseases, while, in numbers,
        they can be physically annoying. For these reasons, they are considered
        pests.
      </p>
      <p>
        Houseflies have been used in the laboratory in research into aging and
        sex determination. Flies appear in literature from Ancient Greek
        mythology and Aesop’s the Impertinent Insectonwards. Authors sometimes
        choose the fly to speak of the brevity of life, which deals with
        mortality subject to uncontrollable circumstances.
      </p>

      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        Adult houseflies are usually 6 to 7 mm (0.24 to 0.28 in) long with a
        wingspan of 13 to 15 mm (0.5 to 0.6 in). The females tend to be larger
        winged than males, while males have relatively long legs. Females tend
        to vary more in size and there is geographic variation with larger
        individuals in higher latitudes. The head is strongly convex in front
        and flat and slightly conical behind.
      </p>
      <p>
        The pair of large compound eyes, almost touch in the male but are more
        widely separated in the female. They have three simple eyes and a pair
        of short antennae. Flies process visual information around seven times
        more quickly than do humans, enabling them to identify and avoid
        attempts to catch or swat them, since they effectively see the human’s
        movements in slow motion with their higher flicker fusion rate.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mouthparts are specially adapted for a liquid diet; the mandibles
        and maxillae are reduced and not functional, and the other mouthparts
        form a retractable, flexible proboscis with an enlarged, fleshy tip, the
        labellum. This is a sponge-like structure that is characterized by many
        grooves, called pseudotracheae, which suck up fluids by capillary action
        It is also used to distribute saliva to soften solid foods or collect
        loose particles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Houseflies have chemoreceptors organs of taste, on the tariff their
        legs, so they can identify foods such as sugars by walking over them.
        Flies are often seen cleaning their legs by rubbing them together,
        enabling the chemoreceptors to taste afresh whatever they walk on next.
        At the end of each leg is a pair of claws, and below them are two
        adhesive pads, pull villi, enabling the fly to walk up smooth walls and
        ceilings.
      </p>
      <p>
        The claws help the fly to unstick the foot for the next step. Flies walk
        with a common gait on horizontal and vertical surfaces with three legs
        in contact with the surface and three in movement. On inverted surfaces,
        they alter the gait to keep four feet stuck to the surface. Flies land
        on a ceiling by flying straight towards it; just before landing, they
        make a half roll and point all six legs at the surface, absorbing the
        shock with the front legs and sticking a moment later with the other
        four, also.
      </p>
      <p>
        The thorax is a shade of gray, sometimes even black, with four dark,
        longitudinal bands of even width on the dorsal surface. The whole body
        is covered with short hairs. Like other Diptera, houseflies have only
        one pair of wings, what would be the hind pair is reduced to small
        halteres that aid in flight stability. The wings are translucent with a
        yellowish tinge at their base. Characteristically, the medial vein (M1+2
        or fourth long vein) shows a sharp upward bend.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each wing has a lobe at the back, the calypter, covering the haltere.
        The abdomen is gray or yellowish with a dark stripe and irregular dark
        markings at the side. It has 10 segments which bear spiracles for
        respiration. In males, the ninth segment bears a pair of claspers for
        copulation, and the 10th bears anal cerci in both sexes.
      </p>
      <p>
        A variety of species around the world appear similar to the housefly,
        such as the Fannie canicularis; the Stomoxys calcitrans and other
        members of the Musa genus, the Australian bush fly and several closely
        related taxa that include M. primitive, M. Shanghainese, M. violacea,
        and M. varensis. The systematic identification of species may require
        the use of region-specific taxonomic keys and can require dissections of
        the male reproductive parts for confirmation.
      </p>

      <h3>Diseases</h3>
      <p>
        Houseflies can fly for several miles from their breeding places,carrying
        a wide variety of organisms on their hairs, mouthparts, vomitus, and
        faeces. Parasites carried include cysts of protozoa. Houseflies do not
        serve as a host or act as a reservoir of any bacteria of medical or
        veterinary importance, but they do serve as mechanical vectors to over
        100 pathogens such as those causing typhoid, cholera, tuberculosis and
        pyogenic cocci, making them especially problematic in hospitals and
        during outbreaks of certain diseases.
      </p>
      <p>
        Disease-causing organisms on the outer surface of the fly may survive
        for a few hours, but those in the crop or gut can be viable for several
        days. Usually, too few bacteria are on the external surface of the flies
        to cause infection, so the main routes to human infection are through
        the fly’s regurgitation and defecation.
