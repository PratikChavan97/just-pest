      <h2>About Vectors and Vector Control</h2>
      <h3>What is a Vector?</h3>
      <p>
        In the science of epidemiology, a disease vector is any agent that
        carries and transmits aninfectious pathogen into another living
        organism; most agents regarded, as vectorsare organisms, such as
        intermediate parasites or microbes, but it could be an inanimate medium
        of infection such as dust particles etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Arthropods form a major group of pathogen vectors with mosquitoes,
        flies, sand flies, lice, fleas, ticks, and mites transmitting a huge
        number of pathogens. Many such vectors are hematophagous, which feed on
        blood at some or all stages of their lives. When the insects blood feed,
        the pathogen enters the blood stream of the host. This can happen in
        different ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Anopheles mosquito, a vector for malaria and filariasis, and various
        arthropod-borne-virusesinserts its delicate mouthpart under the skin and
        feeds on its host’s blood. The parasites the mosquito carries are
        usually located in its salivary glands. Therefore, the parasites are
        transmitted directly into the host’s blood stream. Pool feeders such as
        the sand fly and black fly, which are vectors for pathogens causing
        serious diseases respectively, will chew a well in the host’s skin,
        forming a small pool of blood from which they feed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Triatomine bugs defecate during feeding and the excrement contains
        the parasites which are accidentally smeared into the open wound by the
        host responding to pain and irritation from the bite.

      <h3>What is Vector Control?</h3>
      <p>
        Vector control is any method to limit or eradicate the mammals, birds,
        insects or other arthropods here collectively called “vectors, which
        transmit disease pathogens. The most frequent type of vector control is
        mosquito control using a variety of strategies.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h3>Principle of Vector Control</h3>
      <p>
        Working Principle of Field Oriented Control has the basic theory of the
        field-oriented control, that consists of controlling the stator currents
        represented by a vector. This control is based on projections that
        transform a three-phase time and speed dependent system into a two
        coordinate, d and q frame, time invariant system.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h3>How does Vector Control work in Pre-Construction sites?</h3>
      <p>
        Similar to earth control measures and noise control, contractors are
        required to submit a plan for their vector control ahead of the
        construction works which include but are not limited to the following:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          An in-house pest control team to carry out the vector surveillance and
          control work.
        </li>
        <li>
          External Pest Control Operator (PCO) to supplement the in-house vector
          surveillance and control.
        </li>
        <li>
          Source reduction and effective drainage as the main forms of
          mosquitoes control.
        </li>
        <li>
          In-house pest control team shall carry out search and destroy
          activities of any potential breeding grounds, especially after every
          rainfall, using the “zoning method. This method divides the site into
          a maximum of seven zones and aims for a more effective vector
          surveillance and control by focusing on one zone per day.
        </li>
        <li>
          Apply larvicides or Anti-Mosquitoes (AM) oil to supplement source
          reduction.
        </li>
        <li>
          Thermal fogging is discouraged and shall only be carried out in
          accordance with the criteria stated in Code of Practice for
          Environmental Control Officer.
        </li>
        <li>
          Store food in rodent-proof storage containers/cabinets with at least
          60cm clearance above ground.
        </li>
        <li>Remove food waste daily and clean the bins regularly.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>How Vector Control is done?</h3>
      <h4>Vectors can be controlled using various methods.</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <span>Basic sanitation</span>
          <p>
            This approach targets the elimination or reduction of that part of
            the environment that facilitates breeding and harbourage (places
            where vectors find refuge or shelter). It includes the elimination
            of all possible breeding places for insects, the prevention of
            stagnation of water to limit the breeding of mosquitoes, and proper
            solid waste management and use of a latrine to control the breeding
            of houseflies. The use of clean water from protected sources for
            drinking prevents the transmission of guinea worm. Rats are
            controlled by starving them and eliminating their breeding places.
            Personal hygiene contributes to the control of lice.
          </p>
          <p>
            Generally, a clean home and environment will prevent the breeding of
            insects. The use of ventilation, latrines and adequate water supply
            play a significant role in the control of insects.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Physical measures</span>
          <p>
            These include methods that stop vectors from getting into close
            contact with humans, and methods that are used to kill vectors. They
            include bed nets for mosquitoes and wire mesh for flies and
            mosquitoes Mosquito larvae can be controlled in some water
            containers by putting a thin layer of used oil on the surface of the
            water. This acts as a barrier between the water and the air so the
            larvae cannot access oxygen and suffocate. Physical methods also
            include traps such as adhesives to control flies and traps for rats
            and mice. Delousing by boiling or steaming infested clothes are
            physical methods for controlling lice.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Use of chemicals</span>
          <p>
            Chemical insecticides can be used for the destruction of adults and
            larvae of insects. Commonly used chemicals are DDT, malathion and
            pyrethrums. Pyrethrum-containing aerosols are used for the
            destruction of cockroaches and flies in our homes. Rodenticides can
            be used to kill rats and mice. The indiscriminate use of these
            chemicals, however, could have undesired health effects on users and
            domestic animals. Extreme care should be taken during the
            application and storage of chemicals. It is always important to look
            at the instructions for using the chemical. Environmental health
            workers and veterinary technicians may be able to assist in the use
            of chemicals against vectors
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Biological methods</span>
          <p>
            These include several very advanced methods that prevent the
            successful reproduction of pest species. They include the
            sterilisation of males ,tsetse fly, mosquito, sex distortion or
            replacement of genes. All of these methods are expensive and often
            complex to monitor. Other biological methods involve introducing or
            encouraging predators of the vector species. For example, small fish
            can be used to feed on larvae of mosquitoes. Reptiles, birds and
            frogs feed on adult insects and cats will prey on rats.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Integrated approach</span>
          <p>
            Integrated vector management includes a combination of two or more
            of the above methods. This is often more effective than using a
            single method of control. For example, the rat population may be
            significantly reduced by combining starving with trapping.
            Sanitation can be combined with other cheap methods in order to be
            both sustainable and effective.

      <h3>How can we prevent Vector borne diseases?</h3>
      <p>
        One must avoid contact with blood, secretions, organs or other bodily
        fluids of infected people or animals. One must make sure that he keeps
        strict hygiene control of food and avoidunpasteurized dairy products in
        areas where tick-borne encephalitis can be transmitted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Vector control can be achieved by bird control, mosquito pest control,
        using mosquito spray, which is a potent and best mosquito killer.
        Outdoor mosquito repellents also must be used, whereas mosquito spray
        for home can be used indoors. There are many natural mosquito killers
        those can be used as mosquito repellents.
      </p>
      <p>
        House fly control measures should also be adopted, as fly spray for
        house, house fly repellent, house fly killer spray for fly control.
