      <h3>Carpet Infestation</h3>
      <p>
        Termites love to live close to wood; however, they have been found in
        cellulose-based materials as well including carpets, photograph frames
        and books.
      </p>
      <p>
        They reproduce in early summer and in late spring give birth to new
        colonies. These multiply at a quick rate and often find space under the
        carpet. These are normally found at the corners sticking to the carpet.
        They do not usually cause much damage to it other than some marks;
        however, carpets serve as a great place for them to grow which is why it
        is important to be careful.

      <h3>Termite Foundation Damage</h3>
      <p>
        Termites can cause long-lasting damage to the foundation of your home or
        office. Subterranean termites, one of the most common types of termites
        in India, are known for their destructive natures. They live underground
        and are known to forage in soil in order to find food. Exposed gaps or
        wood underground allows these termites to cause damage to a property’s
        foundation. It may take time but the damage can be extensive and must be
        controlled.
      </p>
      <p>
        As per most pest control providers, one of the best options is to have a
        relevant solution to this problem. Some common solutions include the use
        of pesticide to treat the soil. Plus, bait may also be used to catch and
        remove termites. Many experts also suggest installing an aluminum layer
        to prevent infestation.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to these termites can damage your ceiling and laminate
        flooring as well. To sum it up, they are dangerous for the whole house
        as almost every corner of your house is open to them. In order to save
        your property from getting damaged by these insects, it is important
        that you seek help from an experienced professional provider so that the
        damage can be minimized.
