        Bed bugs are very small insects, which are devoid of wings. Bed bugs
        feed only on the live blood of warm blooded animals, such as human
        beings. Humans become the perfect host for feeding for all species of
        bed bugs.

        Two species of bed bugs are known to feed on human blood. Their names
        are Cimex Lectularius and Cimex Hemipterus. Both the species have been
        found in the ancient tombs of Egypt, which was dated 3500 years before.

        Bed bugs are insects, those have evolved as nest parasites for over
        millions of years. Bed bugs lived in the bird nests and in the bat
        roosts. Some of these bed bugs slowly learned to adapt in human
        environment. Nymphs, or hatching, which are the bed bugs just newly
        born, are very small but they can be viewed, which is about a size of a
        poppy seed. Adult bed bugs grow to the size of an quarter inch in
        length, having an oval shaped body. Their body becomes flat when they do
        not feed on blood. These bed bugs can grow double in size, when they
        have their stomach full of human blood.

        Bed bugs are so called because these insects love to live in human
        homes. They live in sofas, in bed mattresses, in soft furnishing and in
        clothing. They love darkness and hate light. Bed bugs are an increasing
        problem in every types of habitats, where humans live. The bed bugs may
        be white, light tan or dark brown in colour. They prefer dark cracks or
        crevices as their shelter.
