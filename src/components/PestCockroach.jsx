      <h3>What is meant by cockroach control?</h3>
      <p>
        Cockroach control is the regulation or management of a species defined
        as a cockroach, a member of the animal kingdom that impacts adversely on
        human activities. Control of these pests is attempted through exclusion,
        repulsion, physical removal, or by chemical means.

        inside home must be sealed, especially in dark places, such as cupboards
        or any cracks in the building. It should be sealed with caulks, any
        water leakage should be repaired and all moisture from the crawl places
        of cockroaches must be removed. Ventilation must be improved in all dry
        places to make and keep them dry.

      <h3>About Cockroach</h3>
      <p>
        Cockroaches are a type of insects. The Cockroaches belong tothe order
        Blattodea, from family Arthropoda. Termites are also included in this
        order. About 30 cockroach species out of 4,600 are associated with human
        habitats. About four species are well known as pests creating problems
        for human society.
      </p>
      <p>
        The word cockroach is a corruption of the Spanish cucaracha. The
        cockroach is characterized by a flattened oval body, long threadlike
        antennae, and a shining black or brown leathery integument. The head is
        bent downward, and the mouthparts point backward instead of forward or
        downward as is the case in most other insects. The male usually has two
        pairs of wings, whereas the female, in some species, is wingless or has
        vestigial wings.
      </p>
      <p>
        The female produces eggs in egg cases (called oothecae). These are
        sometimes held protruding from her body or may be glued in protected
        areas. After the female deposits an egg case, the soft white nymphs
        emerge. As their external skeleton hardens, it turns brown in colour.
        The structure and large size (certain species have a wingspread of more
        than 12 cm [4.7 inches]) of cockroaches have made them objects of
        interest in the biological laboratory.

      <h3>History of Cockroaches</h3>
      <p>
        The cockroaches are an ancient group of insects, dating back at least as
        far as the period of Carboniferous time, may be some 320 million years
        ago. Those early ancestors however lacked the internal sex organsof
        modern cockroaches. Cockroaches are somewhat generalized insects without
        special adaptations like the sucking mouthparts of aphids and other real
        bugs; they have chewing mouthparts and are likely among the most
        primitive of living insects from neopteran era.
      </p>
      <p>
        They are common and hardy insects and can tolerate a wide range of
        environments from Acute cold to desert heat. Tropical cockroaches are
        often much bigger than temperate species, and, contrary to popular
        belief, the relatives of extinct cockroachesand others, such as the
        Carboniferous cockroaches and the other species at that time, were not
        as large as the biggest modern species.

      <p>
        The cockroach prefers a warm, humid, dark environmentand is usually
        found in tropical or other mild climates. Only a few species have become
        pests. The cockroach damages more material than it consumes and emits a
        disagreeable odour. The diet of the roach, which includes both vegetable
        and animalproducts, ranges from food, paper, clothing, and books to dead
        insects, especially bed bugs. Strong insecticides are used in cockroach
        control.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cockroaches are commonly found in buildings and homes because they
        prefer warm environments, which are close to food and water.
