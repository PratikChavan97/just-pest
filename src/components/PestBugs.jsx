        bed bugs are difficult to see with naked eyes during the day. Often, the
        discovery of these bugs is far worse than imagined. Eradicating the bed
        bugs is just as difficult, although certainly not impossible, especially
        for a trained professional. The professional pest control company looks
        for both live and dead bugs, shed skin from the molting process, spots
        or streaks of dark brown faecal matter, and small off-white eggs.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the inspection, the pest controller will suggest for the
        appropriate bed bug elimination method. The combination of innovative
        tools and experience allows the exterminator to choose an effective and
        safe treatment for exterminating bed bugs from the house. Regardless of
        which treatment the exterminator uses, the goal is to target the bugs
        and their larvae. That way, the larvae cannot mature into adults that
        breed, bite, and cause potentially dangerous disease.
