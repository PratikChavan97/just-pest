      <h3>The health dangers spread by mosquitoes</h3>
      <p>
        India is experiencing major health threats every year from mosquito
        borne diseases, in this country. While the dengue outbreak in Delhi has
        hit the national headlines, little attention has been given to equally
        worrying data from states such as Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu,
        which between them account for almost half of India’s 22,079 dengue
        cases till September 13, the last day till when country-wide data is
        available.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mosquito-borne diseases including chikungunya, dengue, malaria and
        Japanese encephalitis cases has been on the rise across the country,
        with chikungunya recording 300%, the highest, increase in cases between
        2012-2015.Meanwhile, dengue cases increased 157%, followed by Japanese
        encephalitis cases clocking 124% rise, according to National Health
        Profile 2017 report.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chikungunya cases showed a declining trend until 2012, when it recorded
        the lowest number of cases that is 15,977. Thereafter, the numbers
        surged drastically to 58,264, according to the 2016 (provisional)
        data.With death toll rising following the rapid spread of mosquito-borne
        diseases in the country, India’s success in achieving its target to
        eliminate these diseases seems unclear

      <h3>Mosquito Control- the need of the hour</h3>
      <p>
        Mosquito control manages the population of mosquitoes to reduce their
        damage to human health, economies, and enjoyment. Mosquito control is a
        vital public-health practice throughout the world and especially in the
        tropics because mosquitoes spread many diseases, such as malaria and
        Zika virus.

      <h3>Measures to Mosquito Control</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Monitoring the population of mosquito in a defined area and keeping
          them from growing.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reduction the breeding and growing sources of mosquitoes, such as
          emptying the standing water in the area.
        </li>
        <li>
          Biological Control of mosquitoes breeding and growing by introducing
          Gambusia fishes in the ponds of stranded water, who eat the mosquito
          larvae. It also introduces infection through pathogensto target
          mosquitoes to kill them.
        </li>
        <li>
          Adoption of experimental biological control methods to mosquito
          killing by introducing large number of sterile males to the area.
        </li>
        <li>
          Larva of mosquitoes can be trapped by providing artificial breeding
          grounds to them.
        </li>
        <li>The adult mosquitoes can be trapped by genetic engineering.</li>
        <li>
          Addition of oil drips in water is an eco-friendly way of mosquito
          control.
        </li>
        <li>
          Larvae of mosquito can be killed by exposing the larvae to contact
          poison, the mosquito insecticides.
        </li>
        <li>
          Adult mosquitoes can be controlled by mosquito pest control on both
          ground level or aerial level.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Role of Pest Control in Mosquito Control</h3>
      <p>
        The role of a good pest control service to control mosquitoes in either
        a residential or a commercial area is very much beyond any doubt.
        Mosquitoes are infamous for spreading extremely dangerous diseases such
        as malaria, dengue, brain fever, cerebral malaria and filariasis. Having
        a mosquito infestation in close proximity to a person and his family is
        an extremely dangerous situation and can be fatal. The primary goal is
        to keep homes and families safe from mosquitoes.
