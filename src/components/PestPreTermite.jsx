        commercial purpose, requires a super heavy investment. Sometimes this
        investment claims the savings of a life time of a person, who is getting
        his house built. This infrastructure must be protected from all dangers

        termites infestation is a major cause of irrevocable damage to such
        buildings. Pre-Construction pest control is a mandatory pest control

      <h3>
        Why one needs Pre-construction protection from termites and other pests?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Termite infestation is the biggest danger at the site of the future
        construction. Termites are specially attracted to wooden materials.
        Timbers and woods used in construction of the house are the targeted
        items of termite attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Termites live underground. It must be ensured that there is no termite
        colony on or near the building site. Termites are capable of causing
        irreversible damage to a house, that is being constructed. Termite pest
        control is necessary to ensure safety of the house.
      </p>
      <p>
        Termites are hard to be seen with naked eyes. One needs a team of
        experts to detect the presence of a termite colony on or near the
        building site.

      <h3>Pre-Construction Termites Pest Control</h3>
      <p>
        It is easy to eradicate termites once the termites are detected. One
        must hire the services of a professional pest control service provider
        company to provide termite control service at the building site. The
        commonly used termite control processes are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          To find out the termite colony and to find out the termite queen at
          the building site and fully destroy it to ensure complete termite
          control at the site.
        </li>
        <li>
          To use physical barriers such as stainless-steel mesh, to protect the
          house from termites by preventing entrance of termites into the
          building.
        </li>
        <li>
          To use graded granites as a physical barrier for protection of the
          house against termite infestations.
        </li>
        <li>
          To use Reticulation system to prevent termite infestation in the
          house. A series of pipes are installed under the slabs in this
          reticulation system. These pipes carry termite pesticides and termite
          control chemicals at the time of termite infestation in the house, to
          destroy termites.
        </li>
        <li>
          An effective termite control solution must be taken from an effective
          pest control service provider company, such as Just Pest Management
          Services in Mumbai, Thane & Navi-Mumbai, for effective
          Pre-Construction termites and other pest control, at the site of house
          construction for protection of the house from termites and other
          pests, those can damage the house.
