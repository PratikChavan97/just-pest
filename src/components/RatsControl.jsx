        <h2>Rats-Mice-Mouse Control</h2>

        <h3>
          The First Step for Rat Control is Sanitation, Inspection and Exclusion
        </h3>
        <p>
          Regular Inspection is an important first step in getting rid of rats.
          Once you know the location of the rats, you can set traps or place
          bait.
        </p>
        <p>
          To Exclude is an important rodent control technique. It will get rid
          of the rats by making it difficult for them to enter the home or
          structure. Rats are easier to exclude than mice because rats a
          typically larger. Mice can enter an opening as small as 3/8″ wide. All
          openings greater that 1/4″ should be sealed to exclude mice. For rats,
          all openings greater that 1/2″ should be sealed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rats are wary of new objects, new foods or changed in environment.
          They are constantly exploring surroundings and notice changes and are
          suspious by nature. This is why traps and bait stations may be avoided
          for a day or two. They approach new food or object with caution.
          Within a rat colony, they may be a few rats that are extra cautious
          and manage to avoid traps or eating rodent baits.
        </p>

        <h3>The Second Step for Rat Control is Trapping or Baiting</h3>
        <p>
          The most effective methods to get rid of rats is trapping them and
          placing rodent baits.

          Rat, the term generally and indiscriminately applied to numerous
          members of several rodent families having bodies longer than about 12
          cm, or 5 inches. Smaller thin-tailed rodents are just as often
          indiscriminately referred to as mice. In scientific usage,rat applies
          to any of 56 thin-tailed, medium-sized rodent species in the genus
          Rattus native to continental Asia and the adjacent islands of South
          east Asia, eastward to the Australia-New Guinea region. A few species
          have spread far beyond their native range in close association with
          people. The brown rat, also called the Norway rat, and the house rat,
          also called the black rat, ship rat, or roof rat, live virtually
          everywhere that human populations have settled; the house rat is
          predominant in warmer climates, and the brown rat dominates in
          temperate regions, especially urban areas. Most likely originating in
          Asia, the brown rat reached Europe in the mid-1500s andNorth America
          around 1750. The house rat most likely originated in India.
        </p>
        <p>
          Brown and house rats exploit human food resources, eating and
          contaminating stored grains and killing poultry. They have been
          responsible for the depletion or extinction of native species of small
          mammals, birds, and reptiles, especially on oceanic islands. Both the
          brown and house rat have been implicated in the spread of 40 diseases
          among humans, including bubonic plague, food poisoning murine typhus
          tularaemia and leptospirosis. On the other hand, the brown rat has
          been used in laboratories worldwide for medical, genetic, and basic
          biological research aimed at maintaining and improving human health.
          Rats are also kept as pets.
        </p>

        <h3>Features</h3>
        <p>
          Rats are generally slender with a pointed head, large eyes, and
          prominent, thinly furred ears. They have moderately long legs and
          long, sharp claws. The bald soles of their narrow hind feet possess
          fleshy pads of variable size, depending on species. The brown rat has
          a larger body than the house rat, and its tail is shorter relative to
          the body. The brown rat also has thicker fur and 12 pairs of teats
          instead of 10. Tail length among rats ranges from shorter than body
          length to appreciably longer. The tail appears smooth and bald but is
          actually covered with very short, fine hairs. In a very few species,
          these hairs become longer toward the tip, which gives the tail a
          slightly tufted appearance. As with any large group of rodents, body
          size varies within the genus. Most species are about the size of
          Hoffman’s rat, native to the Indonesian island and weighing 95 to 240
          grams (3.4 to 8.5 ounces), with a body length of 17 to 21 cm (6.7 to
          8.3 inches) and a tail about as long. One of the smaller species is
          Osgood’s rat of southern Vietnam, with a body 12 to 17 cm long and a
          somewhat shorter tail. At the larger extreme is the Sulawesian
          white-tailed rat measuring 19 to 27 cm long with a tail of 26 to 34
          cm.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like Hoffman’s rat, most species have a moderately short, soft, and
          dense coat. In some species the coat may be thicker and longer,
          somewhat woolly, or long and coarse; in others, such as the Sulawesian
          white-tailed ratof India, long and slender guard hairs resembling
          whiskers extend 4 to 6 cm beyond the coat on the back and rump. Very
          few Rattus species have spiny fur. Hoffman’s rat also exhibits the
          basic colour pattern seen in the genus—upperparts of brownish yellow
          peppered with black to dark brown and speckled with buff and
          underparts from silvery gray to dark gray, sometimes suffused with
          buff tones. Tail, ears, and feet are dark brown. As with fur texture,
          colour is variable. The Sikkim rat has brownish upperparts and a pure
          white underside; the Himalayan field rat has a brown back, gray
          underparts, and feet of pearly white. Others have very dark fur, such
          as the rat native to islands off the west coast of Sumatra. It has
          brownish black upperparts and a grayish black belly. Although the tail
          is uniformly gray to dark brown in most rats ,sometimes nearly black,
          a few species show one of two bicoloured patterns: brown on the tail’s
          entire upper surface with a paler tone or pure white on the
          undersurface, as in the Himalayan field rat and the Turkestan rat or
          brown all around the basal third to half of the tail with the rest
          uniformly white, as in Hoogerwer rat and the white-tailed rat of
          Sulawesi.
        </p>

        <h3>Natural Habitat</h3>
        <p>
          In their natural habitats rats are primarily nocturnal—the brown rat
          is a prominent exception, being active day and night in both urban and
          rural environments. All rats are terrestrial, and many are also
          arboreal. The Sulawesian white-tailed rat is an excellent climber and
          exhibits the classic combination of arboreal traits within rats, a
          very long tail relative to body length, extremely long guard hairs
          over the back and rump, and wide hind feet with prominent, fleshy
          footpads. This rodent den among the roots of large trees and forages
          high in the crowns of understory and canopy trees. By contrast, those
          species having a tail considerably shorter than body length, short
          guard hairs over the back and rump, and inconspicuous pads on the
          soles of their hind feet tend to be primarily ground-dwelling. Most
          rats can swim; species with thick and somewhat woolly fur generally
          swim well, and some are adept swimmers that forage in aquatic
          environments. The brown rat, for example, has a terrestrial rat’s
          characteristic morphology and is a comparatively poor climber, but it
          has dense fur and readily enters lakes and streams and sewers to hunt
          for fish, invertebrates, or other food. The house rat, on the other
          hand, is extremely agile above the ground, being able to climb and run
          along narrow branches and wires.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rats are thought to eat everything, a conception that comes from
          familiarity with the highly adaptable brown rat and house rat, but
          diet actually differs according to species and habitat. Where it lives
          with humans, the house rat does consume nearly anything digestible,
          especially stored grains. The brown rat is basically omnivorous but
          prefers a carnivorous diet, aggressively pursuing a wide variety of
          prey including shrimp, snails, mussels, insects, bird eggs and young,
          amphibians, eels, fish, pheasant, pigeons, poultry, rabbits, and
          carrion. Many rainforest species, including the Sulawesian
          white-tailed rat and Hoffman’s rat, eat only fruit and the seeds
          within, but some, such as the Philippine forest rat, also eat insects
          and worms. Other tropical species, such as the rice-field rat and
          Malayan field rat, primarily consume the insects, snails, slugs, and
          other invertebrates found in habitats of forest patches, secondary
          growth, scrubby and fallow fields, palm plantations, and rice fields
        </p>
        <p>
          Some rats excavate burrows or build their nests beneath boulders,
          rotting tree trunks, or other kinds of shelter on the forest floor;
          they may also shelter in deep rock crevices or caves and in dwellings
          from small village huts to large city buildings. Rat reproduction has
          been most intensively studied in the brown rat. This prolific rodent
          reaches sexual maturity at three months and may produce up to 12
          litters of 2 to 22 young (8 or 9 is usual) per year, with peaks in the
          spring and autumn and a gestation period of 21 to 26 days. Breeding
          occurs throughout the year in many tropical species but in others may
          be restricted to wet seasons or summer months. Litter sizes in
          tropical forest species tend to be much smaller (one to six), and
          seasonal breeders, particularly in Australian habitats, produce
          significantly fewer annual litters.

        <h3>Classification</h3>
        <p>
          Members of the genus ratsare native to temperate and tropical
          continental Asia, the Australia–New Guinea region, and islands between
          those landmasses. Five clusters of species within the genus are
          recognized by some authorities.
        </p>
        <p>
          The norvegicus group, consisting only of the brown rat, may have
          originated in northern or northeastern China .
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of the 20 species in the ratgroup are specialto subtropical and
          tropical Asia from peninsular India to southeastern China, Southeast
          Asia, Taiwan, some islands in the Philippines, and Sulawesi. They live
          in lowland and montane rainforests, scrublands, agricultural and
          fallow fields, and human structures. In addition to the house rat, the
          distributions of four other species extend outside continental
          Southeast Asia, beyond to some Pacific islands, and most likely
          represent introductions caused by human activities.
