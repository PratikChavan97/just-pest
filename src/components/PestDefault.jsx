      <h2>About Pests and Pest Control</h2>
      <h3>What Is a Pest?</h3>
      <p>
        A pest is any animal or plant which has a harmful effect on humans,
        their food or their living conditions. Pests include animals which:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Carry disease-causing micro-organisms and parasites, for example,
          mosquitoes which carry Ross River virus and Murray Valley
          encephalitis.
        </li>
        <li>
          Attack and eat vegetable and cereal crops, for example, caterpillars
          and grasshoppers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Damage stored food. For example, rats and mice may eat grain in silos,
          rice or biscuits in shops and homes and contaminate this food with
          their faeces or droppings and urine.
        </li>
        <li>
          Attack and eat farm and station animals. For example, feral dogs,
          dingoes kill or maim many sheep and goats each year; foxes will kill
          poultry, lambs and many species of native wildlife; and feral cats
          also prey on native wildlife.
        </li>
        <li>Damage clothing. Silverfish, for example, eat holes in clothes.</li>
        <li>
          Damage buildings. For example, termites can cause considerable damage
          to timber in buildings.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bite people. For example, bed bugs (so called because they often bite
          people in their beds) are very difficult and expensive to control.
          Their bites can cause great irritation to those bitten and, like
          mosquito bites, can become infected if scratched.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        There are thousands of different kinds of pests which are harmful to
        humans. The great majority of these are types of insect.

      <h3>What is Pest Control?</h3>
      <p>
        Pest control is the regulation or management of a Species defined as a
        Pest, a member of the animal kingdom that impacts adversely on human
        activities. The human response depends on the importance of the damage
        done, and will range from tolerance, through deterrence and management,
        to attempts to completely eradicate the pest. Pest control measures may
        be performed as part of an integrated pest management strategy or
        planning for pest control.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h3>How are the Pests harmful for humans?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Pests are defined as any harmful, noxious or troublesome organism.
        </li>
        <li>
          Common pests include insects, mites, rodents, bed bugs, cockroaches,
          ants, termites, wood borers, lizards, etc, which wreak havoc on
          people, plants, animals or the entire ecology in general.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pests and their negative effects on people, pests are injurious to
          health. Pests can act as carriers for allergens which irritate people
          with sensitive medical conditions. Pest’s faecal dropping and shed
          skin can also become airborne, contaminating the air we breathe in.
        </li>
        <li>
          This does not even include the bacteria that can be found on pests
          themselves.
        </li>
        <li>
          Common household pests such as <span>cockroaches</span>,{" "}
          <span>rats</span> and <span>mosquitoes</span> are carriers for
          infectious diseases and must be exterminated lest they overrun a
          household
        </li>
        <li>
          In particular, <span>Cockroaches</span> can slip through any crack in
          the walls, bringing with them bacteria such as salmonella and E. coli.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Rodents</span>, <span>Mouse</span> and <span>Rats</span>,
          likewise carry salmonella on their bodies, leaving a trail of
          contamination on every surface.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Mosquitoes</span>, on the other hand, carry dengue fever. As
          they breed in stagnant water, it is highly recommended that water
          containers be frequently used up and covered.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Bed Bugs</span> suck blood from the sleeping people, who are
          lying on the beds, infested by bed bugs. This can lead to many of the
          diseases, borne by blood circulation and blood transfusion.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Termites</span> and <span>Woodborersare</span> responsible in
          destroyingproperties worth billions of rupees, by destroying the
          entire housing infrastructure and its fixtures, with in and out of the
          housing infrastructure.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Ants</span>, <span>Lizards</span> and <span>Bees</span> or{" "}
          <span>Wasps</span> do not cause any direct damage to humans but may
          act as indirect nuisance value to human homes and to entire human
          society.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why Pest Control is Needed?</h3>
      <p>
        Pest control is necessary to preserve home and working premises from the
        unwanted invaders. Home is the place for one to live safely, and
        certainly not a place for the bugs, termites, and rodents. But
        sometimes, due to some loopholes, pests get the golden chance to intrude
        in home, causing several diseases. Before the pests’ torment one, one
        must take the necessary measures and actions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pests can enter anyone’s home by tiny holes near the doors or windows,
        places which are otherwise unnoticed. Pests always tend to come in a
        gang, they don’t generally prefer solo act. So, if one sees that there
        is just one cockroach or any bug for that matter, then be sure that the
        rest of the gang members are also present nearby. There are certain
        chemical products available in the market, and one can remove the pests
        one self. But it is judicious to opt for professional pest control
        service.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pest control is made up of all the methods and practices of keeping
        pests away. Its application goes beyond what we usually know of it in
        homes. It is used in agriculture and in other vital industries.
      </p>

      <h3>Importance of Pest Control</h3>
      <blockquote>
        <span>
          <q>Pest Control brings Health and saves Wealth</q>
        </span>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Beyond its use in homes, pest management is very important for us for a
        number of reasons. Here are some of those reasons:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          One of the most important reasons why pest control is needed is
          because of health. Pests can bring diseases that can be quite serious.
          One of the most serious epidemics, the bubonic plague which caused
          millions of deaths in the World in Medieval times came from rats and
          other rodent pests. Cockroaches and other pests can also carry germs
          into their body. That should be your main concern when it comes to
          having pests in your home.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pests can have an impact on production and resources. This is the main
          reason why pest control is vital to in agriculture and other
          industries. Sometimes pests can be such a huge problem that they will
          seriously affect the production of one industry. They can wipe out
          production and bring it down to zero if they are not controlled.
        </li>
        <li>
          Aside from the damage that they can do to resources and production,
          they can also cause some serious damage to existing structure and
          things. Sometimes the damage can be so severe that a whole structure
          would be rendered useless because of it, like in cases where termites
          have eaten away at a wooden structure.
        </li>
        <li>
          Then there is also the fact that pest control is needed in order to
          keep appearances. Whether it is a home or an office, having pests
          running around is never going to be a good thing. It would have to be
          taken care of.
        </li>
      </ul>
