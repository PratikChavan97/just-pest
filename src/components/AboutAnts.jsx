        Ant, from family Formicidae, any of approximately 10,000 species of
        insects that are social in habit and live together in organized
        colonies. Ants occur worldwide but are especially common in hot
        climates. They range in size from about 2 to 25 mm, about 0.08 to 1
        inch. Their colour is usually yellow, brown, red, or black. A few genera
        have a metallic lustre.

      <h3>Anatomy</h3>
      <p>
        Typically, an ant has a large head and a slender, oval abdomen joined to
        the thorax or midsection, by a small waist. In all ants there are either
        one or two finlike extensions running across the thin waist region. The
        antennae are always elbowed. There are two sets of jaws: the outer pair
        is used for carrying objects such as food and for digging, and the inner
        pair is used for chewing. Some species have a powerful sting at the tip
        of the abdomen.

      <h3>Castes</h3>
      <p>
        There are generally three castes or classes, within a colony: queens
        males, and workers. Some species live in the nests of other species as
        parasites. In these species the parasite larvae are given food and
        nourishment by the host workers. Wheeleriella santschii is a parasite in
        the nests of Monomorium salomonis, the most common ant of northern
        Africa.

      <h3>Ants Habitats</h3>
      <p>
        Most ants live in nests, which may be located in the ground or under a
        rock or built above ground and made of twigs, sand, or gravel. Carpenter
        Ants or Camptonites are large black ants common in North America that
        live in old logs and timbers. Some species live in trees or in the
        hollow stems of weeds. Tailor, or weaver, ants, found in the tropics of
        Africa e.g., Tetramorium, make nests of leaves and similar materials
        held together with silk secreted by the larvae. Dolichoderus, a genus of
        ants that are found worldwide, glues together bits of animal faeces for
        its nest. The widely distributed pharaoh ant or Monomarium pharaonis, a
        small yellowish insect, builds its nest either in houses, when found in
        cool climates, or outdoors, when it occurs in warm climates.
      </p>
      <p>
        Army ants, of the subfamily Dorylinae, are nomadic and notorious for the
        destruction of plant and animal life in their path. The army ants of
        tropical America for example, travel in columns, eating insects and
        other invertebrates along the way. Periodically, the colony rests for
        several days while the queen lays her eggs. As the colony travels, the
        growing larvae are carried along by the workers. Habits of the African
        Driver ants are similar.

      <h3>Ants Social behavior</h3>
      <p>
        The social behaviour of the ants, along with that of the honeybees, is
        the most complex in the insect world. Slave-making ants, of which there
        are many species, have a variety of methods for “enslaving the ants of
        other species. The queen of Bothriomyrmex decapitans of Africa, for
        example, allows herself to be dragged by Tapinoma ants into their nest.
        She then bites off the head of the Tapinoma queen and begins laying her
        own eggs, which are cared for by the “enslaved Tapinoma workers. Workers
        of the slave-making ant Protomognathus americanus raid nests of
        Temnothorax ants, stealing the latter’s pupae. The pupae are raised by
        P. americanus to serve as slaves, and, because the Temnothoraxpupae
        become imprinted on the chemical odour of the slave-making ants, the
        captive ants forageand routinely return to the slave-making ant nest.
