        The most obvious sign of bedbugs in the home is that people complain of
        bites that occurred while they were asleep. If this happens, examine the
        bedrooms for bedbugs and signs of bedbug activity. Look carefully in bed
        linen and the seams and tufts of mattresses and box springs for bugs or
        eggs. The eggs will look like very small poppy seeds.

        Signs of bedbug activity may occur beneath loose areas of wallpaper near
        beds, in the corner of desks and dressers, in the laundry, and in
        drawers. Keep an eye out for dark brown or rust-colored bedbug droppings
        that stain material and mattresses. Bedbug excrement is a liquid that
        looks either light brown or black, and it usually either beads up or is
        absorbed by the material around it.
