      <h2>Pest Control Treatment for Wooden Furniture and Structures</h2>
      <p>
        Wooden Structures and Furniture need to be protected from multiple
        pests, who destroy these wooden products beyond any possibility of
        recovery. Wooden structures and furniture are expensive and they also
        provide support to many vital structures. Any weakness in wood can
        result in collapse of the entire infrastructure.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is always best to take preventive measures for protection of wood
        rather than having pest control, once the wood is infested with pests.
        It is not possible save the wooden structure then as it is destroyed
        from inside the wood.

            <h5>Pest Control for Wood Borers-</h5>
            <p>
              Wood borers turn the wood into powder. These reproduce within the
              wood. Their larvae eat away the wood while growing up. Wood Borers
              need to be checked in the beginning only. The wood must be dry.
              Proper pesticide solution of Borate insecticide should be sprayed
              over the wooden structure. Fumigation has also proved to be very
              helpful in controlling Wood Borer.

            <h5>Pest Control for Termites-</h5>
            <p>
              Termites or White Ants are omni present. Termites are wood
              killers. Moisture invites termites and the wood must be completely
              dry to be termite resistant.
            </p>
            <p>
              Borate insecticide spray also works effectively over termites.
              Fumigation method is also equally effective to control termites.
              It is a repetitive process.

            <h5>Pest Control for Carpenter Bee-</h5>
            <p>
              Carpenter bee is same as common bee. They build nests in woods.
              They destroy the wood in this process by making tunnels in the
              wood. Repeated fumigation has been found effective in making the
              carpenter bee fly away.
