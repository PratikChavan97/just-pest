      <h2>Wood Borer Pest Control/Managment</h2>
      <p>
        The term woodboring beetle encompasses many species and families of
        beetles, whose larval or adult forms eat and destroy wood. In the
        woodworking industry, larval stages of some are sometimes referred to as
        woodworms. The three most speciose families of woodboring beetles are
        longhorn beetles, bark beetles, and weevils, and metallic flat- headed
        borer.

      <h3>Ecology of Wood Borer</h3>
      <p>
        Woodboring beetles most often attack dying or dead trees. In forest
        settings, they are important in the turnover of trees by culling weak
        trees, thus allowing new growth to occur. They are also important as
        primary decomposers of trees within forest systems, allowing for the
        recycling of nutrients locked away in the relatively decay-resilient
        woody material of trees. To develop and reach maturity woodboring
        beetles need nutrients provided by fungi from outside of the inhabited
        wood. These nutrients are not only assimilated into the beetles’ bodies
        but also are concentrated in their frass, contributing to soil nutrients
        cycles. Though the vast majority of woodboring beetles are ecologically
        important and economically benign, some species can become economic
        pests by attacking relatively healthy trees or by infesting downed trees
        in lumber yards. Species such as the Asian longhorn beetle and the
        emerald ash borer are examples of invasive species that threaten natural
        forest ecosystems.

      <h3>Invasion of Wood Borer</h3>
      <p>
        Woodboring beetles are commonly detected a few years after new
        construction. The lumber supply may have contained wood infected with
        beetle eggs or larvae, and since beetle life cycles can be one or more
        years, several years may pass before the presence of beetles becomes
        noticeable. In many cases, the beetles will be of a type that only
        attacks living wood, and thus incapable of “infesting" any other pieces
        of wood or doing any further damage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Genuine infestations are far more likely in areas with high humidity,
        such as poorly ventilated crawl spaces. Housing with central
        heating/air-conditioning tends to cut the humidity of wood in the living
        areas to less than half of natural humidity, thus strongly reducing the
        likelihood of an infestation. Some species will infest furniture.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some beetles invade wood used in construction and furniture making;
        others limit their activity to forests or roots of living trees. The
        following lists some of those beetles that are house pests

      <ul>
        <li>
          Inspect timber and wood products when selecting, if possible, or when
          delivered to your home for emergence holes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Firewood should be debarked, split, speed drying, and stored away from
          structures.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use wood that has been kiln or air dried to reduce moisture that is
          favorable to wood-infesting beetles.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reduce moisture inside the home with proper ventilation, drainage, and
          dehumidifiers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Treat unfinished wood with a borate product such as Bora-care or
          Timbro, before sealing, to prevent damage from wood-destroying
          organisms.
        </li>
        <li>Infested branches or limbs outdoors can be burned.</li>
